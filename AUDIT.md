Two points that should be improved most are reducing the amount of code per function and reducing the number of branch points.
First of all I will check if there is duplicate code, so I could create one function in the helper functions file, while I can remove code from the data visualisation files. Although I think there are definitely some sections that can be improved other sections of code are impossible to reduce in amount, since D3 simply requires a lot of code for all different components, such as axes, tooltips, bars, legendas etc. 

The same counts for reducing the number of branch points. I will look into replacing some if/else statements, but some of my visualisations require multiple conditions to be activated or not.
