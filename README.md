##Datavisualising Project: Antibiotic Resistance and Consumption

###Shan Li Nio, 6222420

##Purpose
Due to the worldwide frequent use of antibiotics, the number of bacteria resistant to these antibiotics is increasing. This webpage was designed to make people more aware of which types of antibiotic resistance exist and which pathogenic bacteria developed resistance. It also makes people aware of the consumption of several of these antibiotic families in european countries.
