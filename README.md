# Final-Project
Datavisualisation of the antibiotic consumption in europe and bacteria resistant to these antibiotics.

Problem
==================
With this data visualisations the user can observe all bacterium species resistant to a certain antibiotic (family). And the consumption of this antibiotic (family) in europe. Simultaneously it can also show for each individual bacterium to which antibiotics it developed resistance. 


Features
==================
Visual components
------------------
To solve this problem a chord diagram-like visulation will be implemented, which will consist out of two circles: an inner-circle which will contain the different antibiotic families and an outer-circle which will contain different resistant bacterium species. When a certain antibiotic-family is clicked, several chords will connect this family to the bacterium species in the outer-circle which are resistant to this selected family. Simultaneously a new window opens with a chloropleth heat map which shows the consumption of the selected antibiotic-family for each european country. When an individual country is clicked a new window opens with a bar chart that shows the consumption of all different antibiotic families.
Interactive components

what problem will be solved for the user

what features will be available to solve the problem

a visual sketch of what the application will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out; not in full detail though

what data sets and data sources will you need, how you will get the data into the right form for your app

what separate parts of the application can be defined (decomposing the problem) and how these should work together

what external components (APIs) you probably need to make certain features possible

technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these

a review of similar applications or visualizations in terms of features and technical aspects (what do they offer? how have they implemented it?)
